How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? I interpret user needs by using user feedback to better the program. Creating User Stories helps with this because it gives the development team an idea of what user want and they are able to use that to provide the best product for the users. 
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? I approach developing programs by giving myself a time frame. Felxibilty and adaptability are important in devolping and using those to my advantage to ensure I am completing what is needed while also allowing myself to make changes as needed. 
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? A good team member collaborates. Working together is the best thing you can do as a team. A good team member completes their tasks and informs the rest of the team of any problems as soon as possible. I think a good team member uses communication and follows direction as well.
